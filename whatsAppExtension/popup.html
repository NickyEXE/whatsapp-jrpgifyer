    <p>Clicking the below button will activate the JRPG transformer.</p>
    <p>You'll be prompted to choose your character (this avoids breaking the app), then you'll be sent back to WhatsApp.</p>
    <p>After that, clicking on a message will start the story at that minute! So start where you want to begin reading.</p>
    <p>You can also set it to follow messages in real time.</p>
    <p>Going up will break you out of real time, while sending a message will put you into real time.</p>
